This project explores philosophy, covering famous thinkers, existentialism, and perception. To me, philosophy is closely tied to history, books, and education, which inspired this websiteâ€™s design. The content was curated by Inji. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it integrates the Are.na API for content.
